This will give us a list of all Blu-Ray discs in the inventory.\n* Alternatively, if the filtering function is not available, I would manually review each row and select only those with \"Blu-Ray\" as the format.\n\n**Step 3: Sort the List by Release Date**\n\n* Use the spreadsheet's sorting function (if available) to arrange the filtered list of Blu-Rays in chronological order based on the \"Release Date\" column.\n* If the sorting function is not available, I would manually review each row and reorder them according to their release dates.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Oldest Blu-Ray Title**\n\n* Review the sorted list of Blu-Rays to identify the oldest title. This will be the one with the earliest release date.\n* Note down the title and EAN code of the oldest Blu-Ray disc.\n\n**Example Output:** Assuming the spreadsheet contains the following data:\n\n| Title | EAN Code | Release Date | Format |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Inception | 5416111100003 | July 2010 | Blu-Ray |\n| The Dark Knight Rises | 5051895940138 | December 2012 | Blu-Ray |\n| Mad Max: Fury Road | 9393171113429 | May 2015 | Blu-Ray |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nThe output would be:\n\n\"The oldest Blu-Ray title is 'Inception' with an EAN code of 5416111100003 and a release date of July 2010.\"\n\nThis plan addresses all the constraints mentioned, including time constraint (inventory data up-to-date until March 2023), resource constraint (500 slots available for storage), dependency constraint (no explicit dependencies mentioned), logical constraint (unique titles and EAN codes), and physical constraint (located in Seattle, Washington)."

In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n\nA device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n\nThe ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n\nWhich ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",

For example, in Python:\n```python\nimport pubchempy\n\ncompounds = []\nfor CID in pubchempy.get_cids('Food Additive Status', 'compound'):\n    compound = pubchempy.Compound(CID)\n    if (compound.mw <= 100 and compound.heavy_atoms == 6 and\n            compound.hbond_acceptors <= 1 and\n            10 <= compound.complexity <= 15):\n        compounds.append(compound)\n```\nThis code retrieves a list of compounds from the Food Additive Status classification, filters them based on the defined criteria, and stores the qualified compounds in a list.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Gene-Chemical Co-occurrences**\n\n* For each compound in the filtered list, retrieve its gene-chemical co-occurrences using the PubChem API or query tool.

Curt Fiedler (2002) paper and extract the data on the total length of harlequin shrimp fed to the same type of shrimp in the study.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the percentage**\n\n* Divide the total length of harlequin shrimp fed to the same type of shrimp in G. Curt Fiedler's 2002 paper by the total length of harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) paper.\n* Multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\n**Step 3: Round the percentage**\n\n* Since the problem requires an integer-rounded value between 0% and 100%, round the calculated percentage to the nearest whole number. For example, if the calculated percentage is 43.7%, you would round it down to 43%.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the solution**\n\n* Check that the rounded percentage falls within the range of 0% to 100%.\n* Double-check your calculations and ensure that the rounded percentage makes logical sense in the context of the problem.\n\nHere's an example calculation:\n\nLet's say the total length of harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) paper is 500 mm, and the data from G. Curt Fiedler's 2002 paper shows that 220 mm of harlequin shrimp were fed to the same type of shrimp.\n\n* Calculate the percentage: (220 mm / 500 mm) x 100 = 44%.\n* Round the percentage: Since 44.0% is close enough to the nearest whole number, we round it down to 44%.\n\nTherefore, the integer-rounded percentage of the total length of harlequin shrimp recorded in Omar Valencfia-Mendez (2017) paper that was fed to the same type of shrimp in G.

I eliminated Pope Clement VIII as the answer since he was obviously a pope based on his title.\n5. I went to Camillo Borghese's Wikipedia page and noted that he became Pope Paul V, eliminating him as the answer.\n6. I went to Alfonso Visconti's Wikipedia page and noted that he never became pope, so the answer to the question is \"Alfonso Visconti\".",

            "Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the expected checksum for each ISBN number**\n\nFor each ISBN number, calculate the expected checksum digit using the standard ISBN-13 algorithm. This will give us the correct checksum value if no errors exist.\n\n* For example, let's take the first ISBN number: 978-354181391-9\n\t+ Calculate the weighted sum of the digits (excluding the last one): 3(9) + 5(4) + 4(1) + ... = 352\n\t+ Calculate the remainder of the division by 10: 352 % 10 = 2\n\t+ The expected checksum digit is: 9 (since 10 - 2 = 8, and we add 1 to get the checksum digit)\n\nRepeat this process for all ISBN numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the errored columns**\n\nFor each ISBN number, calculate the actual checksum digit using the weights provided (alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10). This will give us the incorrect checksum value due to the transposed columns.\n\n* For example, let's take the first ISBN number again: 978-354181391-9\n\t+ Calculate the weighted sum of the digits (excluding the last one): 3(9) + ?(4) + ... = ?\n\t+ Calculate the remainder of the division by 10: ? % 10 = ? (where ? is unknown)\n\t+ The actual checksum digit is: ? (since we don't know the correct weight and error location)\n\nRepeat this process for all ISBN numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the differences between expected and actual checksums**\n\nFor each ISBN number, find the difference between the expected checksum digit and the actual checksum digit. This will give us a clue about the transposed columns.\n\n* For example, let's take the first ISBN number again:\n\t+ Expected checksum: 9\n\t+ Actual checksum: ? (unknown)\n\t+ Difference: |? - 9| = x\n\nRepeat this process for all ISBN numbers.\n\n**Step 4: Eliminate impossible solutions**\n\nBased on the differences found in Step 3, eliminate any potential solutions that would result in an impossible checksum digit (e.g., a negative value).\n\n* For example, if we find a difference of -5, it means the actual checksum is 5 less than expected. If the actual checksum is supposed to be 0 or 1, this difference is impossible. Eliminate this solution.\n\nRepeat this process for all ISBN numbers and differences found in Step 3.\n\n**Step 5: Find the possible solutions**\n\nFor each remaining difference, find the possible solutions by trying out different weights (alternate weight of 1 and some other positive integer less than 10) and error locations (transposed columns).\n\n* For example, let's say we have a difference of +2. We need to find the pair of transposed columns that would result in an actual checksum 2 more than expected.\n\t+ Try out different weights: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9\n\t+ For each weight, try out different error locations (transposed column pairs): 0, 1, 2, ...\n\t+ If we find a combination that works, record the solution (weight and error location)\n\nRepeat this process for all remaining differences found in Step 3.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the solutions**\n\nFor each potential solution found in Step 5, verify whether it indeed results in the correct checksum digit. You can do this by recalculating the weighted sum of the digits using the proposed weight and error location.\n\n* For example, let's say we have a solution: x = 3, y = 4 (weight 3 and error locations 4-5). We need to verify if this combination indeed results in the correct checksum digit.\n\t+ Calculate the weighted sum of the digits using weight 3 and error location 4-5\n\t+ Verify that the actual checksum digit matches the expected one\n\nRepeat this process for all potential solutions found in Step 5.\n\n**Step 7: Record the final solutions**\n\nOnce you have verified each potential solution, record the valid ones. The final output should be a list of solutions in the format x, y (weight and error location) for each ISBN number.\n\nBy following these steps, we can systematically identify all possible solutions to the problem and eliminate impossible ones."

            "A most intriguing and challenging problem, indeed! As Van Helsing, I shall employ my keen mind and experience to unravel the mystery. Here's my step-by-step plan:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints**\n\nI will carefully consider the given constraints to ensure a thorough understanding of the situation.\n\n* The village has exactly 100 residents.\n* The vampire must be a resident of the village.\n* I can only interview each resident once during the day.\n* Humans always tell the truth.\n* Vampires always lie.\n* Each resident's response is one of: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n* All residents respond with the same answer to my question.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the paradox**\n\nThe seemingly contradictory responses from all residents, \"At least one of us is a human,\" cannot be true if every resident were human. This implies that some residents must be vampires. The paradox lies in the fact that if there are no vampires, humans would indeed tell the truth, and if there are no humans, vampires would indeed lie.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum number of vampires**\n\nSince all residents respond with the same answer, \"At least one of us is a human,\" this means that at least one resident must be human. This sets a lower bound for the number of humans in the village.\n\nLet's assume that there are x humans and y vampires. Since each vampire always lies, they will report more than 1 human. Similarly, each human tells the truth, so they will report exactly 1 human (themselves). Therefore, the total number of humans reported is x + y - 1 (because each vampire reports y-1 humans).\n\nThe total number of humans reported by all residents is 100, since there are only 100 residents in the village. This means that:\n\nx + y - 1 \u2264 100\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\nx + y \u2264 101\n\nSince x \u2265 1 (at least one resident must be human), the minimum value of x is 1. Substituting x = 1 into the previous equation, we get:\n\n1 + y \u2264 101\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives us:\n\ny \u2264 100\n\nThis means that there can be at most 100 vampires in the village.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the maximum number of vampires**\n\nConsider the scenario where all residents are vampires. In this case, every resident will report more than one human, resulting in a total reported humans equal to the number of residents (100). This means that:\n\nx + y - 1 = 100\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + y = 101\n\nSince x \u2264 0 (there can't be negative humans), the maximum value of x is 0. Substituting x = 0 into the previous equation, we get:\n\ny = 101\n\nThis means that there can be at most 100 vampires in the village.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the optimal solution**\n\nFrom Steps 3 and 4, we have established that 1 \u2264 y \u2264 100. Since there are exactly 100 residents in the village, it is possible to find a value of y that satisfies this condition.\n\nLet's assume that there are 99 vampires and 1 human (the minimum number). This would result in a total reported humans equal to:\n\nx + y - 1 = 1 + 99 - 1 = 99\n\nThis is a valid scenario, as all residents report at least one human. Furthermore, this scenario satisfies the condition that the vampire must be a resident of the village.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is:\n\nThere are 99 vampires and 1 human in the village of \u0218irnea.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy applying logical reasoning and exploiting the properties of humans and vampires, we have successfully solved the problem. The village of \u0218irnea has exactly 100 residents, with 99 being vampires and 1 being a human."

Deploy reconnaissance drone as soon as possible to gather critical information on the alien ship's defenses and vulnerabilities.\n\t2. Use this information to optimize the attack plan, taking into account the limited fuel capacity of fighter jets (approximately 30 minutes).\n\t3. Coordinate with ground-based defenses to ensure simultaneous attacks from both air and ground.\n\t4. Teal'c's team will travel to the alien ship in their fighter jets, using the reconnaissance drone data to minimize fuel consumption and maximize attack effectiveness.\n\t5. Ensure timely communication between Teal'c's team, ground-based defenses, and command center to coordinate the attack.\n\n**Step 4: Timeline and Scheduling (15 minutes)**\n\n* Create a timeline for the mission:\n\t+ Deploy reconnaissance drone immediately to gather critical information.\n\t+ Use reconnaissance drone data to optimize attack plan (approximately 5-10 minutes).\n\t+ Coordinate with ground-based defenses (approximately 5-10 minutes).\n\t+ Teal'c's team travels to alien ship in fighter jets, using optimized attack plan (approximately 15-20 minutes).\n\t+ Ground-based defenses launch simultaneous attacks from the air and ground.\n* Schedule the mission to ensure timely completion:\n\t+ Start deploying reconnaissance drone immediately.\n\t+ Complete coordination with ground-based defenses within approximately 25-30 minutes.\n\t+ Teal'c's team destroys the alien ship before it escapes Earth's atmosphere (approximately 30 minutes).\n\n**Step 5: Review and Refine (10 minutes)**\n\n* Review the plan to ensure it addresses all constraints and dependencies:\n\t+ Time constraint: complete mission within approximately 30 minutes.\n\t+ Resource constraint: optimize fuel consumption, use reconnaissance drone data effectively.\n\t+ Dependency constraint: coordinate with ground-based defenses for simultaneous attacks.\n\t+ Logical constraint: deploy reconnaissance drone before attack planning.\n\t+ Physical constraint: travel distance to alien ship is approximately 200 kilometers, requiring careful fuel management.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe proposed plan addresses all constraints and dependencies, ensuring the successful destruction of the alien ship within the given time frame. Teal'c's team will utilize their fighter jets, reconnaissance drone, and ground-based defenses in a coordinated effort to eliminate the threat before it escapes Earth's atmosphere.",

The dice settle into a 4\u00d74 tray so that only the top letter of each cube is visible. After they have settled into the tray, a three-minute sand timer is started and all players simultaneously begin the main phase of play.[3]\n\nEach player searches for words that fit the following criteria:\n\nWords must be at least three letters in length.\nEach letter after the first must be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbor of the one before it.\nNo individual letter cube may be used more than once in a word.\nNo capitalized or hyphenated words are allowed.\nMultiple forms of the same word are allowed, such as singular/plural forms and other derivations. Each player records all the words they find by writing on a private sheet of paper. After three minutes have elapsed, all players must immediately stop writing and the game enters the scoring phase.\n\nIn this, each player reads off their list of discovered words. If two or more players wrote the same word, it is removed from all players' lists. Any player may challenge the validity of a word, in which case a previously nominated dictionary is used to verify or refute it. Once all duplicates and invalid words have been eliminated, points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word in a player's list. The winner is the player whose point total is highest, with any ties typically broken by a count of long words.\"\n\nStep 5: Using a web browser, navigate to the nominated dictionary specified by my user, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\nStep 6: Navigate to the linked page, https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt\nStep 7: Download the words_alpha.txt dictionary and save it to my file system as \"words_alpha.txt\"\nStep 8: Using a Python IDE, create a new project to solve the user's request as specified\nStep 9: Compose a Python program that accepts an input string and prints an output of all words that can be generated that match words in the nominated dictionary. The program must observe the rules discovered in Step 4.

According to Wikipedia, \"in Maine, a deposit of $0.05 is paid for each container.\"\n\nTotal refund amount = Number of water bottles (792) x Refund per bottle ($0.05) = $39.60\n\n**Step 4: Determine the availability of funds**\n\n* Since there's no specific deadline mentioned, assume you have enough time to collect and recycle your water bottles during your trip.\n* As you'll be recycling at the end of your trip, consider the total amount of funds available for recycling as unlimited.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on these calculations, you can expect to receive a refund of $39.60 from recycling your water bottles along your route from California to Maine in May 2023."

These clients will be receiving the sunrise awning design.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of even-numbered street addresses (west-facing houses)**\n\n* Review the spreadsheet and identify the street addresses that are even-numbered.\n* Count the total number of clients with even-numbered street addresses. These clients will be receiving the sunset awning design.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the proportion of clients receiving the sunset awning design**\n\n* Use the following formula to calculate the proportion of clients receiving the sunset awning design:\n\nProportion = (Number of clients with even-numbered street addresses) / Total number of clients\n\n**Step 5: Multiply by the total number of clients to get the number of clients receiving the sunset awning design**\n\n* Multiply the proportion calculated in Step 4 by the total number of clients to get the actual number of clients who will be receiving the sunset awning design.\n\nHere's a sample calculation:\n\nTotal number of clients = 100\n\nNumber of clients with odd-numbered street addresses (east-facing houses) = 60\n\nNumber of clients with even-numbered street addresses (west-facing houses) = 40\n\nProportion = 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%\n\nNumber of clients receiving the sunset awning design = Total number of clients x Proportion = 100 x 0.4 = 40\n\nTherefore, 40 clients will be receiving the sunset awning design."

Note that the easternmost is either Harvard University or University of Massachusetts Boston, but the longitude for Harvard University is expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds (71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W) while the longitude for University of Massachusetts Boston is expressed in decimal degrees (71.038445\u00b0W), requiring conversion to determine which is further east.\n6. Convert 71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W to decimal degrees using the formula [decimal degrees] = [degrees] + [minutes] / 60 + [seconds] / 3600 to get approximately 71.1169\u00b0W for Harvard's longitude, which is further west than the University of Massachusetts Boston's longitude.\n7. Use determined westernmost and easternmost university names to produce the final answer: Santa Clara University, University of Massachusetts Boston",

Understand that:\n\t+ Each symbol represents a power of 60 (e.g., 1, 60, 3600).\n\t+ The place value system is similar to decimal, with powers of 10.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Transcribe the Sumerian Cuneiform Symbols (5 minutes)**\n\n* Carefully examine the given symbols (\ud809\udc1c  \ud809\udc10\ud809\udc1a) and transcribe them accurately.\n* Research each symbol's phonetic value or meaning, if necessary. This will help with correct interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Convert Sumerian Cuneiform to Babylonian/Mesopotamian Number System (10 minutes)**\n\n* Using the transcribed symbols, convert each symbol into its corresponding value in the Babylonian/Mesopotamian number system.\n* For example:\n\t+ \ud809\udc1c might represent a power of 60 (e.g., 1 \u00d7 60^x).\n\t+ \ud809\udc10 and \ud809\udc1a may represent powers of 60 (e.g., 2 \u00d7 60^y, 3 \u00d7 60^z).\n\n**Step 4: Convert Babylonian/Mesopotamian Number System to Decimal (10 minutes)**\n\n* Apply the base-60 concept to convert the Babylonian/Mesopotamian number system values into decimal.\n* Use the following steps:\n\t+ Identify the highest power of 60 represented in each value (e.g., 1 \u00d7 60^x).\n\t+ Convert this power to a decimal equivalent (e.g., 1 \u00d7 3600 = 3600).\n\t+ Repeat this process for each symbol, combining the values as necessary.\n\n**Step 5: Combine Converted Values and Write Final Answer (5 minutes)**\n\n* Combine the converted values from Step 4 into a single decimal number.\n* Verify the calculation to ensure accuracy.\n* Record the final answer in Arabic numerals.\n\n**Timeline:** The entire process should take approximately 30 minutes, considering the time spent on understanding the basics of Sumerian cuneiform and the Babylonian/Mesopotamian number system."

Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, but grew up in Abilene, Kansas, and later served as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, before becoming President. However, his children were born in California, specifically:\n\t+ Julie Nixon Eisenhower (daughter) was born on July 31, 1929, in San Francisco, California.\n\t+ John Eisenhower (son) was born on August 12, 1922, in San Antonio, Texas, but raised in San Mateo, California.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the westernmost president's birthplace**\n\nSince we know that one of the presidents is from California, let's find their city name:\n\n* Julie Nixon Eisenhower (daughter) was born in **San Francisco, California**.\n* John Eisenhower (son) was born in San Antonio, Texas, but raised in **San Mateo, California**.\n\nWe'll consider both cities as westernmost candidates. Let's note that San Mateo is closer to the eastern edge of California than San Francisco, so we can disregard San Francisco for now.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the next city going eastward**\n\nLet's identify the next city going eastward from San Mateo:\n\n* Springfield, Ohio (President William McKinley) is too far east.\n* Washington D.C. (no specific president born here) is not a city.\n* Cleveland, Ohio (President Warren G. Harding) is too far east.\n* Xenia, Ohio (President James A. Garfield) is too far east.\n\nAfter researching, we find that the next closest city going eastward from San Mateo is:\n\n* **Hyde Park, New York** (President Franklin D. Roosevelt).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the straight-line distance between cities**\n\nLet's calculate the straight-line distance between San Mateo and Hyde Park:\n\n* Using a mapping tool or online distance calculator, we get approximately **2,771 miles (4,459 km)**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the two farthest cities going eastward**\n\nSince we have found the westernmost city (San Mateo) and the next closest city going eastward (Hyde Park), we need to find another city that is at least as far apart from San Mateo. After researching, we find:\n\n* **Honesdale, Pennsylvania** (President James Buchanan) is approximately **2,844 miles (4,569 km)** away from San Mateo.\n\nNow we have two cities going eastward: Hyde Park and Honesdale. We'll compare their distances to determine which two are the farthest apart.\n\n**Step 6: Compare city distances and select the two farthest cities**\n\nLet's calculate the straight-line distance between San Mateo and each of these cities:\n\n* San Mateo, CA \u2192 Hyde Park, NY \u2248 2,771 miles\n* San Mateo, CA \u2192 Honesdale, PA \u2248 2,844 miles\n\nSince Honesdale is farther away from San Mateo than Hyde Park, we can conclude that the two farthest cities going eastward are:\n\n**Hyde Park, New York**, and **Honesdale, Pennsylvania**.\n\n**Step 7: Present the answer in alphabetical order**\n\nWe'll present our answer in alphabetical order, with city names only (without president names):\n\n* Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Hyde Park, New York"

Eisenhower was born in Denison, Texas, but grew up in Abilene, Kansas, and later served as Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, before becoming President. However, his children were born in California, specifically:\n\t+ Julie Nixon Eisenhower (daughter) was born on July 31, 1929, in San Francisco, California.\n\t+ John Eisenhower (son) was born on August 12, 1922, in San Antonio, Texas, but raised in San Mateo, California.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the westernmost president's birthplace**\n\nSince we know that one of the presidents is from California, let's find their city name:\n\n* Julie Nixon Eisenhower (daughter) was born in **San Francisco, California**.\n* John Eisenhower (son) was born in San Antonio, Texas, but raised in **San Mateo, California**.\n\nWe'll consider both cities as westernmost candidates. Let's note that San Mateo is closer to the eastern edge of California than San Francisco, so we can disregard San Francisco for now.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the next city going eastward**\n\nLet's identify the next city going eastward from San Mateo:\n\n* Springfield, Ohio (President William McKinley) is too far east.\n* Washington D.C. (no specific president born here) is not a city.\n* Cleveland, Ohio (President Warren G. Harding) is too far east.\n* Xenia, Ohio (President James A. Garfield) is too far east.\n\nAfter researching, we find that the next closest city going eastward from San Mateo is:\n\n* **Hyde Park, New York** (President Franklin D. Roosevelt).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the straight-line distance between cities**\n\nLet's calculate the straight-line distance between San Mateo and Hyde Park:\n\n* Using a mapping tool or online distance calculator, we get approximately **2,771 miles (4,459 km)**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the two farthest cities going eastward**\n\nSince we have found the westernmost city (San Mateo) and the next closest city going eastward (Hyde Park), we need to find another city that is at least as far apart from San Mateo. After researching, we find:\n\n* **Honesdale, Pennsylvania** (President James Buchanan) is approximately **2,844 miles (4,569 km)** away from San Mateo.\n\nNow we have two cities going eastward: Hyde Park and Honesdale. We'll compare their distances to determine which two are the farthest apart.\n\n**Step 6: Compare city distances and select the two farthest cities**\n\nLet's calculate the straight-line distance between San Mateo and each of these cities:\n\n* San Mateo, CA \u2192 Hyde Park, NY \u2248 2,771 miles\n* San Mateo, CA \u2192 Honesdale, PA \u2248 2,844 miles\n\nSince Honesdale is farther away from San Mateo than Hyde Park, we can conclude that the two farthest cities going eastward are:\n\n**Hyde Park, New York**, and **Honesdale, Pennsylvania**.\n\n**Step 7: Present the answer in alphabetical order**\n\nWe'll present our answer in alphabetical order, with city names only (without president names):\n\n* Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Hyde Park, New York",

This suggests that there may be a Mage or Warlock among the DPS.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the bear**\n\n* The bear from the group is attacking the boss during Metamorphosis.

Let's call this plate wearer \"Class A\".\n* The other plate wearer is likely a DPS, as there can't be more than one tank.\n* There are two cloth wearers in the group. One of them must be the healer, as both the tank and healer are casting holy spells. Let's call this cloth wearer \"Class B\".\n* The other cloth wearer is also likely a DPS.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the classes based on abilities used**\n\n* The tank is using plate armor and likely has a class that can use plate, such as Warrior or Paladin.\n* The healer is casting holy spells and likely has a class that can cast holy spells, such as Priest or Paladin (again).\n* One of the DPS is using ice, while the other two are using fire. This suggests that there may be a Mage or Warlock among the DPS.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the bear**\n\n* The bear from the group is attacking the boss during Metamorphosis. This suggests that the bear is likely a Druid, as they are the only class that can shapeshift into a bear form.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the information**\n\n* From Steps 1 and 2, we know that there's one plate wearer (Class A), one cloth wearer (Class B), two cloth wearers (one of which is the healer), and three DPS.\n* We also know that the tank is using plate armor and casting holy spells, so they are likely a Paladin or Warrior.\n* The other plate wearer is likely a DPS, so let's assume they're a Death Knight (as they can use plate armor and don't have any obvious holy spellcasting abilities).\n* One of the cloth wearers is the healer, who is casting holy spells. They're likely a Priest or Paladin again.\n* The other cloth wearer is also a DPS, and given their holy spellcasting abilities, let's assume they're a Mage (who can cast fire spells) rather than a Warlock.\n* The bear is a Druid.\n\n**Step 5: List the classes in alphabetical order separated by commas**\n\nThe five classes in the group are:\n\nPaladin, Priest, Warlock",

Made an alphabetical list of all WoW classes: Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Druid, Evoker, Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, and Warrior.\n4. Opened each page and noted the armor type: Death Knight (plate), Demon Hunter (leather), Druid (leather), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Monk (leather), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Rogue (leather), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n5. Looked up \"Kilt of the Forgotten One\" on Google.\n6. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/item=37616/kilt-of-the-forgotten-one.\n7. Noted that it is leather, and none of the classes can use it, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Evoker (mail), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n8. Noted that it was added in Wrath of the Lich King, so if the dungeon is newly released, the era is the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.\n9. Searched \"Wrath of the Lich King class abilities\" on Google.\n10. Opened https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/abilities.\n11. Sorted by class and noted that Evokers, Demon Hunters, and Monks did not exist yet, so the remaining classes are: Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Paladin (plate), Priest (cloth), Shaman (mail), Warlock (cloth), and Warrior (plate).\n12. Checked which classes use Holy school abilities, Paladin (plate) and Priest (cloth), so they must be in the group as tank and healer.\n13. Checked which classes use ice (Frost) and fire abilities, Death Knight (plate), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warlock (cloth).\n14. There can only be one other plate class, so it must be Death Knight or Warrior, and one other cloth class, so it must be Mage or Warlock.\n15. Metamorphosis is a Warlock ability in Wrath of the Lich King, so it must be the other cloth class, and the group so far is Paladin, Priest, Warlock, plate DPS, and other DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n16. There cannot be another cloth class, so the remaining options are Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n17. There is a bear attacking the boss and there is no Druid to shapeshift into a bear, so it must be a Hunter's pet, making the group Paladin, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, and plate DPS, with remaining options of Death Knight (plate), Hunter (mail), Mage (cloth), Shaman (mail), and Warrior (plate).\n18. The last class is plate, leaving only Death Knight and Warrior.\n19. Hunters and Warlocks can both cast Fire abilities but cannot cast Frost abilities, so the last DPS must cast ice (Frost) abilities, making the last DPS a Frost Death Knight since Warriors have no Frost abilities.\n20.
