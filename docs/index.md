# PlanGEN Documentation

Welcome to the PlanGEN documentation. This guide will help you understand and use the PlanGEN framework for solving complex problems using large language models (LLMs) in a multi-agent approach.

## Overview

PlanGEN is a Python framework that implements the workflow described in the paper "PlanGEN: Generative Planning with Large Language Models." It enables constraint extraction, solution generation, verification, and solution selection through various planning algorithms.

The framework features:

- **Multi-agent system**: Specialized agents for constraint extraction, solution generation, verification, and selection
- **Planning algorithms**: BestOfN, TreeOfThought, REBASE, and MixtureOfAlgorithms
- **Model support**: OpenAI and AWS Bedrock integrations
- **Template-based prompting**: Jinja2 templates for customizable LLM interactions
- **Visualization capabilities**: Graph-based visualization of planning processes

## Getting Started
