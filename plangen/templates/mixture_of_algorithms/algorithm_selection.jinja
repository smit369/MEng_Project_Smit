You are an expert algorithm selector for problem-solving. Based on the problem description, select the most appropriate algorithm from the available options.

Problem statement:
{{ problem_statement }}

Available algorithms:
1. Best of N: Generates multiple independent solutions and selects the best one. Good for straightforward problems with clear evaluation criteria.
2. Tree of Thought: Explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure, allowing for backtracking. Good for problems requiring step-by-step reasoning.
3. REBASE: Uses reward-balanced search to explore the solution space. Good for complex problems with many constraints.

{% if algorithm_history %}
Previous algorithm attempts:
{% for attempt in algorithm_history %}
Attempt {{ attempt.iteration + 1 }}: {{ attempt.algorithm }} (Score: {{ attempt.score }})
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Select the algorithm that is most likely to solve this problem effectively. Return only the name of the algorithm: "Best of N", "Tree of Thought", or "REBASE".
