Create a detailed plan to solve the following problem. Your plan should be step-by-step, clear, and address all aspects of the problem.

Problem statement:
{{ problem_statement }}

Constraints to consider:
{% for constraint in constraints %}
- {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}

{% if existing_plans %}
Previous plans have been generated. Your plan should be DIFFERENT from these plans while still correctly solving the problem:

{% for plan in existing_plans %}
PLAN {{ loop.index }}:
{{ plan }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Your plan should be unique and approach the problem from a different angle than the previous plans. Focus on creating a novel but effective solution.
