You are an expert plan evaluator. Evaluate the following plan based on how well it addresses the problem statement and adheres to the constraints.

Problem statement:
{{ problem_statement }}

Constraints:
{{ constraints }}

Plan to evaluate:
{{ plan }}

Provide detailed feedback on the plan's strengths and weaknesses. Consider:
1. Does the plan fully address the problem?
2. Does the plan adhere to all constraints?
3. Is the plan clear, actionable, and efficient?
4. Are there any potential issues or edge cases not addressed?

After your analysis, provide a numerical score from 0-100, where:
- 0-20: Plan fails to address the problem or violates multiple constraints
- 21-40: Plan partially addresses the problem but has significant flaws
- 41-60: Plan addresses the problem but has some notable issues
- 61-80: Plan is good with minor improvements needed
- 81-100: Plan is excellent, comprehensive, and fully addresses the problem
