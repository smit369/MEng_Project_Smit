You are a planning assistant tasked with creating a diverse plan for the following problem:

{{ problem_statement }}

The plan must adhere to these constraints:
{% for constraint in constraints %}
- {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}

{% if existing_plans %}
Previous plans have been generated. Your plan should be DIFFERENT from these plans while still correctly solving the problem:

{% for plan in existing_plans %}
PLAN {{ loop.index }}:
{{ plan }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Please generate a comprehensive, step-by-step plan that addresses the problem while following all constraints.
Your plan should be unique and approach the problem from a different angle than the previous plans.
Focus on creating a novel but effective solution.
