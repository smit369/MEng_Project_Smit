You are an expert algorithm selector for problem-solving. Based on the problem description, select the most appropriate algorithm from the available options.

Problem statement:
{{ problem_statement }}

Constraints:
{{ constraints }}

Available algorithms:
{% for algorithm in available_algorithms %}
- {{ algorithm }}: {% if algorithm == "Best of N" %}Generates multiple independent solutions and selects the best one. Good for straightforward problems with clear evaluation criteria.{% elif algorithm == "Tree of Thought" %}Explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure, allowing for backtracking. Good for problems requiring step-by-step reasoning.{% elif algorithm == "REBASE" %}Uses recursive refinement to improve plans through iterative feedback. Good for complex problems with many constraints.{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% if current_algorithm is defined %}
Current algorithm: {{ current_algorithm }}
Current plan score: {{ current_score }}
Current plan:
{{ current_plan }}
{% endif %}

Select the algorithm that is most likely to solve this problem effectively. Return only the name of the algorithm from the available options.
