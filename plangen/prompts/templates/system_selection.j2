Consider the following criteria:
1. Completeness: Does the solution address all aspects of the problem?
2. Correctness: Does the solution satisfy all constraints and requirements?
3. Efficiency: Is the solution optimal in terms of resources and steps?
4. Clarity: Is the solution well-explained and easy to understand?
5. Robustness: Does the solution handle edge cases and potential issues?

Provide clear reasoning for your selection and explain why the chosen solution is superior to the alternatives.
