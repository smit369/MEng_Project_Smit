Given the following solution:

{{ solution }}

And these constraints:

{{ constraints }}

Verify whether the solution satisfies all constraints and requirements. For each constraint:
1. State whether it is satisfied or not
2. Provide clear reasoning for your assessment
3. If not satisfied, explain what aspects of the solution violate the constraint
4. Suggest improvements if applicable

Format your verification as a structured analysis with clear conclusions.
