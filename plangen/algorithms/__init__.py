PlanGEN algorithms module

This module provides various planning algorithms that can be used with the PlanGEN framework.
All algorithms implement the BaseAlgorithm interface, making them interchangeable components.

Available algorithms:
- BaseAlgorithm: Abstract base class for all algorithms
- BestOfN: Generates multiple plans and selects the best one
- TreeOfThought: Explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree structure
- REBASE: Uses recursive refinement to improve plans
- MixtureOfAlgorithms: Dynamically selects the best algorithm for the problem
